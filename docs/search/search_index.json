Candlestick Patterns How to Read Candlestick charts? Candlestick charts were originated in Japan over 100 years before the West had developed the bar charts and point-and-figure charts. In the 1700s, a Japanese man known as Homma discovered that as there was a link between price and the supply and demand of rice, the markets also were strongly influenced by the emotions of traders. A daily candlestick charts shows the security\u2019s open, high, low, and close price for the day. The candlestick\u2019s wide or rectangle part is called the \u201creal body\u201d which shows the link between opening and closing prices. This real body shows the price range between the open and close of that day\u2019s trading. When the real body is filled, black or red then it means that the close is lower than the open and is known as the bearish candle. It shows that the prices opened, the bears pushed the prices down and closed lower than the opening price. If the real body is empty, white or green then it means that the close was higher than the open known as the bullish candle. It shows that the prices opened, the bulls pushed the prices up and closed higher than the opening price. The thin vertical lines above and below the real body is knowns as the wicks or shadows which represents the high and low prices of the trading session. The upper shadow shows the high price and lower shadow shows the low prices reached during the trading session.
