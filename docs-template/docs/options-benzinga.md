## The First Greek: Delta
* Definitions of Delta which is a %

1. Rate of Change of option value to the underlying ($1 move)
2. Delta = value between 0.0 and 1.0
3.  Delta = option Exp ITM (not precise mathematically)

Its the amount of change to the preimum for every dollar move in the stock.

i.e. Delta is the % of change the Option will go up in value for the Ask and the Bid.   If the Value of the stock goes up 1 dollar the and if the delta is .47 the Ask and the Bid will go up by .47 cents


## The Second Greek: Gamma

Gamma = RoC of delta as price moves (not linear)

XYZ stock = $50 > $51
Call Delta .50 + gamma (0.03) = .53 delta @$51

Long Puts: XYZ $50 < $49
Put delta .50 + gamma 0.03 = .53 delta @$49

## The Third Greek: Theta

Theta = RoC in option's price over x unit of time
More time = more value, Less time = less value
Value < as T > (not linear)
