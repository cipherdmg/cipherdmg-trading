## Call Option
Gives you the rigth to buy 100 shares for a premium.

If you buy a $10 call for $2.00 then you break even is your (strike price + premium) which is $12.

If this call expired today at $12 you would break even and the intrinsic value of the call contract would be worth $2.00.


## Put Option
Gives you the right to sell 100 shares for for a premium.

If you buy a $10 put for $2.00 then you break even is your (strike price - premium) which is $8.

## Call Scenario

When picking an option is critcal to find a strike price which gives the Intrinsic Value (Target - Strike Price) greater then your break even price which is the amount of Money you spent on the premium to buy the option in the first place.

As Alex Says *Its going to be easier to buy a cheap option and have that cheap option become expnsive then buy an expeisive option and have that expensive option beceome even more expensive.*

In the Example below this is a good option since the option price is cheap [$0.87] and the overal gains from a successful trade (hitting your target) would result in $511.  So an $87 dollar investment returned $511 return which is a 587% return.
